$\zeta = (v_{\text{cmd}} - v_{\text{min}})^2 + \frac{(v_{\text{cmd}} - v_{\text{max}})^2 - (v_{\text{cmd}} - v_{\text{min}})^2}{1 + e^{-k\left(\frac{1}{e^{-k_1D_{\text{target}}/R_{\text{max}}} - \varepsilon}\right)}}$



k (The Steepness Parameter)

    Role: kk controls the steepness or sharpness of the sigmoid function's transition from its minimum to maximum value.
    Effect of High Values: If kk is large, the transition between the two states becomes more abrupt, almost resembling a step function.
    Effect of Low Values: If kk is small, the transition is more gradual, producing a smoother curve over a wider range of vcmdvcmd​ values.

k1k1​ (The Scaling Parameter in the Exponent)

    Role: k1k1​ influences how quickly the exponentiated term e−k1Dtarget/Rmaxe−k1​Dtarget​/Rmax​ decays with respect to the DtargetDtarget​.
    Effect of High Values: A larger k1k1​ makes the decay faster, which means that the impact of changes in DtargetDtarget​ is more pronounced.
    Effect of Low Values: A smaller k1k1​ slows the decay, making the function less sensitive to changes in DtargetDtarget​.

In the sigmoid term \frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(\frac{1}{e^{-k_1D_{\text{target}}/R_{\text{max}}} - \epsilon)}}, kk and k1k1​ work together to determine the switching behavior based on the distance to the target DtargetDtarget​, the range RmaxRmax​, and the threshold ϵϵ. Tuning these parameters can significantly impact the optimization process guided by this cost function.
