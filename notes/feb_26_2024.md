# Notes
- I found out that the yaw command has been messing up my controller
- Instead of setting a reference heading and regulating it, the yaw command in the Drone.py script will make it turn contiously. I then have this weird sitatuion where I am rolling to the right and yawing to the left, which makes my controller fight itself, causing instability.
- With the Jetson Xavier I am able to compute at a rate of 10-30 hz depending on the complexity
- In addition running two parallel nodes doesn't affect the performance 
- Keep in mind code is not compiled yet expect a 4-10x performance rate so realistically maybe 30hz - 50hz controller?
