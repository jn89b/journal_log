# Notes
- I found out that the yaw command has been messing up my controller
- Instead of setting a reference heading and regulating it, the yaw command in the Drone.py script will make it turn contiously. I then have this weird sitatuion where I am rolling to the right and yawing to the left, which makes my controller fight itself, causing instability.
