# MPC with ROS
- Need to check out and verify how mavros works with their callbacks on orientations
- I was able to fix the angle wrapping issues, also important to note that Ardupilot SITL has to go back to loiter point before it can do another test run with the mission

# To do - Put this in Trello Board
- [ ] Get visualizer on ROS2 pipeline to visualize:
    - the trajectories from the nodes 
    - the direction vector and position of the aircraft
    - the effector configuration and how it would be modeled 
- [ ] Effector Cost Functions:
    - Have it offset and configured to where you can have multiple effectors 
- [ ] Effector nodes:
    - Build an effector package where you can define the configuration and layout of each effector and publish damage done to the system 
- [ ] Build each trajectory node:
    - Waypoint Trajectories - (Put this in backlog)
    - Dynamic Threats - Simulate n trajectories from n threats and feed to optimizer to find the best avoidance strategy (Put this in backlog)
    - Engage Trajectory - For omni or directional effector
- [ ] Add a state machine node in the drone_ros package where it subscribes to the different trajectories and makes a decision on which trajectory to conduct
- [ ] Video and plots of the trajectories 
- [ ] Set up equations for presentation
- [ ] Create flowchart/diagraming of architecture of how this works
- [ ] Map the Drone Telem publisher like how the Mavros does it (Backlog)
