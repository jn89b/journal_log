# MPC with ROS
- Need to check out and verify how mavros works with their callbacks on orientations
- I was able to fix the angle wrapping issues, also important to note that Ardupilot SITL has to go back to loiter point before it can do another test run with the mission
- I also noticed that the position of my aircraft is actually ahead of my trajectory, it's actually towards the end of the horizon line, maybe I need to call or look ahead of the MPC?

# To do - Put this in Trello Board
- [x] Get visualizer on ROS2 pipeline to show:
    - [x] the trajectories from the nodes 
    - [x] the direction vector and position of the aircraft
        - Need to make this cheaper to visualize, its super slow right now
    - the effector configuration and how it would be modeled 
- [ ] Effector Cost Functions:
    - Have it offset and configured to where you can have multiple effectors 
- [x] Effector nodes:
    - Build an effector package where you can define the configuration layout of each effector and publish damage done to the system 
- [ ] Build each trajectory node:
    - Waypoint Trajectories - (Put this in backlog)
    - Dynamic Threats - Simulate n trajectories from n threats and feed to optimizer to find the best avoidance strategy (Put this in backlog)
    - [x] Engage Trajectory - For omni or directional effector
- [ ] Add a state machine node in the drone_ros package where it subscribes to the different trajectories and makes a decision on which trajectory to conduct
- [ ] Video and plots of the trajectories 
- [ ] Set up equations for presentation
- [ ] Create flowchart/diagraming of architecture of how this works
- [ ] Map the Drone Telem publisher like how the Mavros does it (Backlog)
