# Potential Gaps in Literature 
- Perception/Tracking
    - Need to identify small objects but how to transfer to parachute? 
    - Cosine similiarity? Computationally cheap 
- Guidance
    - A lot of MPC/Trajectory Optimization stuff 
    - A lot of Gaussian assumptions
    - Don't see updating model based on uncertainty/measurements real time 

# Subproblems
- Aircraft guidance and navigation
    - Aircraft must be able to identify and track the target with uncertainty considerations
    - Aircraft has to fly trajectory with considerations of wind and figure out when it should drop the payload 

- Parafoil guidance and navigation
    - Once deployed the parafoil must be able to guide itself to the target landing location with wind considerations 
    - It must track its target utilizing low cost navigation strategies (can't stick a Jetson Orin with expensive cameras on the system)
