# Potential Gaps
- Perception/Tracking
    - Need to identify small objects but how to transfer to parachute? 
    - Cosine similiarity? Computationally cheap 
- Guidance
    - A lot of MPC/Trajectory Optimization stuff 
    - A lot of Gaussian assumptions
    - Don't see updating model based on uncertainty real time
